Develop a dynamic bar chart using D3.js to visualize a dataset with varying values. The chart features animated transitions for smooth updates and interactive hover effects to highlight data points. Utilizing scalable vector graphics (SVG), the chart dynamically adjusts bar widths based on data proportions, offering an intuitive visual representation. Enhance user interaction with responsive design and clear, readable text labels embedded within each bar.
